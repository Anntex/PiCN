# Hello World!

Make sure that you have Python 3.6+ installed on your machine. In case case of doubt have a look at the output of:

> `python -V`

Also note that we currently develop and test PiCN on Linux and Mac OS X machines. Since Windows handles inter-process communication differently, it is currently not supported.

## Getting Started as a User

**Clone the Repository**

Download the latest version of PiCN to your machine:

> `git clone https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/PiCN.git`

If you run that command in your home directory, the root of PiCN is `~/PiCN`. In case you decided to clone to another directory, adjust the following commands accordingly.

**Run Unit Tests (optional)**

> xxx

**Xxx**

> xxx

**Next Steps**

Congratulations, PiCN runs on your machine! If you want to learn more, go to the [tutorial](tutorial.md).

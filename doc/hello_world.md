# Hello World!

Make sure that you have Python 3.6+ installed on your machine. In case case of doubt have a look at the output of:

Also note that we currently develop and test PiCN on Linux and Mac OS X machines. Since Windows handles inter-process communication differently, it is currently not supported.

# PiCN Simulation System

PiCN includes a simple Simulation System, which helps to verify the forwarding process and can 
be used for tests. 

In fact, for its simulation system, PiCN starts multiple forwarders on a single machine and uses 
a simulation interface to communicate with each other. 
Therefore, the simulation is quiet similar to running an actual network.
